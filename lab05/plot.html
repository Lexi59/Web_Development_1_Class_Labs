        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <h3>Loosely based on the German fairy tale "Rapunzel" in the collection of folk
            tales published by the Brothers Grimm</h3>
        <p>Long ago, a drop of liquid sunlight sprouts a magical healing flower. For centuries,
            Mother Gothel has used the flower to retain her youth, and she is angered when
            soldiers from a nearby kingdom pluck it to heal their ailing and pregnant queen.
            Shortly afterward, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel, whose golden hair
            contains the flower's healing properties. Gothel tries to steal a lock of Rapunzel's
            hair to use the magic once again, but discovers that cutting the hair renders it
            powerless. She instead abducts Rapunzel and raises her as her own in a secret tower.
            In order to keep the confined and isolated Rapunzel content, Gothel teaches her to
            fear the outside world and its people. Each year, the King and Queen release sky
            lanterns on Rapunzel's birthday, hoping for their daughter to see them and return.
            She has known that those lanterns were meant for her, her entire life. A couple times
            she tries to convince Mother Gothel to let her out, but Gothel does not let her.</p>

            <p>On the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel asks to leave the tower and discover
            the lanterns' source, but Gothel refuses. Meanwhile in the kingdom, a thief named Flynn
            Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace and ditches his partners, the
            Stabbington brothers, while fleeing. He takes refuge with the crown in Rapunzel's tower,
            but Rapunzel knocks him unconscious and hides him in the closet. Gothel returns, and
            Rapunzel tries to show Flynn to her to demonstrate her readiness for the "dangerous"
            outside world. However, Gothel still dismisses her.</p>

           <p> Rapunzel sends Gothel away on a three-day journey to acquire paints. With Gothel gone,
            Rapunzel hides the crown from Flynn and leverages it to persuade him to escort her to
            see the lanterns for her birthday. Along the way, Flynn brings Rapunzel to the Snuggly
            Duckling, a pub filled with menacing thugs, who initially try to capture the wanted Flynn,
            but Rapunzel charms them instead. Meanwhile, Gothel encounters Maximus, a palace horse
            determined to capture Flynn. Recognizing that kingdom guards may be closing in on her
            hidden tower, she returns there to check on Rapunzel, but she only discovers Flynn's
            satchel with the stolen crown and she goes after the pair.</p>

           <p> Royal soldiers led by Maximus arrive at the pub in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn
            escape through a passage, but they find themselves trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned
            to their fate, Flynn reveals his real name, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Rapunzel reveals that
            her hair glows when she sings. They use the light to escape the cave and take refuge in
            the forest. That night, Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to
            Rapunzel and suggests using it to test Eugene's loyalty.</p>

            <p>In the morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to arrest Flynn, but Rapunzel dictates
            a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reach the kingdom and enjoy the birthday festivities;
            this culminates in an evening cruise as the King, Queen, and townsfolk release the lanterns.
            There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown for fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in
            person. They confess their love and are about to kiss when Eugene notices the Stabbingtons
            on the shore. He leaves Rapunzel to give them the crown as an apology, but they assault him
            and tie him to a boat headed for the palace. Eugene is detained while the brothers convince
            Rapunzel that Eugene has abandoned her. Gothel stages a rescue by disabling the brothers and
            returns with Rapunzel to the tower.</p>

            <p>There, Rapunzel suddenly recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she has subconsciously
            incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess
            for whom the people send the lanterns, she angrily confronts Gothel. At the same time, Maximus
            and the Duckling thugs help Eugene escape captivity, and Maximus rushes him back to Gothel's
            tower. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel chained and gagged.
            Gothel stabs Eugene and tries to flee with Rapunzel. Rapunzel agrees to go willingly if Gothel
            allows her to heal Eugene first. Wanting her to be free, Eugene cuts off her hair, which turns
            brown and loses its magic, causing Gothel to age rapidly. Enraged, Gothel accidentally falls
            out the window to her death. Eugene confesses his love once more and dies.</p>

            <p>A heartbroken Rapunzel mourns for Eugene, but one of her tears, still containing the flower's
            magic, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom where the King
            and Queen reunite with their daughter and pardon Eugene. Finally, after a time, Rapunzel marries
            Eugene.</p>
